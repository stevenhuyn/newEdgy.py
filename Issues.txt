The current animate function never ends, so you can't call it multiple times without having to manually close the matplotlib window
This is due to the pylab.block thing, so that the graph stays up when ran through cli.
This is solved if ran through the shell, but how do you run through shell on things that aren't IDLE?

animate(G, algo, **kwargs) vs animate(algo(G, **kwargs))
