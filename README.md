# newEdgy.py
Helper function to quickly draw small networkx graphs, with some extended functions to aid animation.  
Based off of the edgy.py file from the VCE Algorithmic course 2017.  
For networkx, matplotlib 2.0 and python 3.5+.

**Usage**  
Only file necessary is newEdgy.py, look at minimalTemplate.py for the quickest and dirtiest way to animate/convert existing algorithms.
